Dynoforms
=========

Dead-simple javascript forms built from JSON schemas, with a somewhat Djangonic influence.

TODO
----

- Update 3rd parameter on render() so that it take props and passes them to
  child components directly. One of these *must* be a key, which needs to be
  unique for child components. *sigh*
- Tests
